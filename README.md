# Portfolio-Platform
This is a web-based multi-user platform where authenticated users can create, manage, and showcase structured project documentation. Users can create entries with rich content: text, code snippets, images, videos, and GIFs. They can rearrange the layout of documentation blocks using a drag-and-drop interface.
